## Nmap scan takes a very long time

Since the `nmap` will search all devices on your network, performing it on large public networks (e.g. school or company WiFi) will be very time-consuming.

**Workarounds**:

* If possible, use a private network (such as your home WiFi).

* Alternatively, consider using a mobile hotspot or a direct ethernet connection.
